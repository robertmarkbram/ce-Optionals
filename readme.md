# The difference between map() and flatMap()

Testing how `Optional` works by seeing `map()` and `flatMap()`, which have very similar versions in `Stream`.

Classes in `src/test/java/org/rmb/math` contain various methods that I exercise in `src/test/java/org/rmb/math` to show how the `map()` and `flatmap()` methods work in `Stream` and `Optional`.
